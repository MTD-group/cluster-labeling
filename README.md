# Cluster Labeling
This repository contains codes for cluster labeling of FCC lattice using a modified version of Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm. The algorithm is adapted from the paper ["Extension of Hoshenâ€“Kopelman algorithm to non-lattice environments"](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4371(02)01586-8) and accordingly modified for FCC environments. The cluster labeling algorithm can be used to extract variety of information related to percolation theory such as the percolation threshold for a given sublattice size, the cluster size distribution, correlation length, etc.
